# Landing page

This project consists in making a landing page, for the final assessment on The Odin Project Foundations course on basic HTML & CSS.

## Known limitations to consider:
- The image placeholder and the hero main text (This website is awesome...) wraps. When wrapped, the image does not align to the middle.
- The hero looks janky on ultrawide monitors. Too much space between text and image.
